I'm **Jiayu Li** a first year master student from [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by [Asst.Prof. Wanyu Lin](https://wanyu-lin.github.io/). Before that, I graduated from the [School of Mathematics](https://maths.hfut.edu.cn/) at Hefei University of Technology in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, advised by [Assoc.Prof. Xing Yan](https://maths.hfut.edu.cn/info/1029/4370.htm).

# Research
My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, my research focuses on collaboration-based trustworthy AI, with an emphasis on interpretability, robustness, and privacy preservation. This includes areas such as multi-agent systems with LLMs, LLM-based evaluation, and knowledge distillation.

# Hobbies
I particularly enjoy photography (mainly landscape photography), instrumental music (especially the background music from [Genshin Impact created by HOYO-MiX and Chen Zhiyi](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lmIKBwTkO-jl4msnIYfZJdEtPE9FJ8dBU&si=koSAAsDK3U_IhfRn)), and comedy (such as crosstalk and stand-up).
