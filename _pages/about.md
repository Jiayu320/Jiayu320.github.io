I'm **Jiayu Li** a first year master student from [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by [Prof. Wanyu Lin](https://wanyu-lin.github.io/). Before that, I graduated from the [School of Mathematics](https://maths.hfut.edu.cn/) at Hefei University of Technology in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, advised by [Prof. Xing Yan](https://maths.hfut.edu.cn/info/1029/4370.htm).

# Research
My research interests lie in **AI agents** and **multi-agent systems**. Currently, I focus on efficient LLM collaboration inference, aiming to enhance the reasoning capabilities and overall efficiency of collaborative systems. I am passionate about advancing the development of intelligent, efficient Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). My long-term goal is to realize self-organizing AI systems that can autonomously leverage tools to accomplish complex, real-world tasks.

# Hobbies
I particularly enjoy photography (mainly landscape photography), instrumental music (especially the background music from [Genshin Impact created by HOYO-MiX and Chen Zhiyi](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lmIKBwTkO-jl4msnIYfZJdEtPE9FJ8dBU&si=koSAAsDK3U_IhfRn)), and comedy (such as crosstalk and stand-up).
