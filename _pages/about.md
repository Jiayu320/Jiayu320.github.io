# Research
My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, my research focuses on collaboration-based trustworthy AI, with an emphasis on interpretability, robustness, and privacy preservation. This includes areas such as multi-agent systems and LLM-based evaluation. I am eager to contribute to the advancement of an era characterized by intelligent and trustworthy Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

# Hobbies
I particularly enjoy photography (mainly landscape photography), instrumental music (especially the background music from [Genshin Impact created by HOYO-MiX and Chen Zhiyi](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lmIKBwTkO-jl4msnIYfZJdEtPE9FJ8dBU&si=koSAAsDK3U_IhfRn)), and comedy (such as crosstalk and stand-up).
